## About
My neovim config. Mostly stuff I've learned/stolen from other nvim users.
I'm doing my best to learn vim and use it as my main text editor and IDE.

## Installing:
Install wbthomason/packer.nvim
```shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```
Or just get the AUR package, whatever works..

Clone this repository into your $HOME.config folder
run `nvim +PackerSync`

Configure to your liking

## TODO
- [ ] god, i need a vertical monitor so bad
- [ ] tweak the  configs and change the keybinds
- [ ] actually learn vim, lmao
